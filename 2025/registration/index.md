# Registration

Please do not apply for two simultaneous courses. If it is found that you registered for two simultaneous courses and had the necessary attendance in both of them, none of the certificates will be issued.

Please be sure to fill out your name and email in both the registration form and all attendance forms in exactly the same way. We compute attendance using a Python script that may not be able to match two different versions of the same name. 

The classes will be recorded unless the lecturer chooses otherwise. By registering for a course, you agree to this and to the video being later shared on YouTube.
