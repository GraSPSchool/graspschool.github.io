Hello, there! I'm Níck. I got my MSc degree at the Federal University of ABC, a bit after getting my BSc at the University of São Paulo's Institute of Physics. I work on the intersections between high-energy physics, mathematical physics, and gravitation.

Hey Folks! I'm Caio, I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at the Federal University of Ceará. I work as an undergrad research assistant in the Quantum Field Theory and Gravitation Group, and I have been working mainly in aspects of the Unruh effect, Hawking radiation and black hole shadows. You can find out more about me [here](https://usingcaio.github.io/).

Hi! I'm Clara, a theoretical physicist currently pursuing a PhD in the Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Gravitation program (PPGCosmo) at the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), Brazil. I completed my MSc in Physics at the University of Valencia and earned my undergraduate degree in Physics Education from the University of Seville, both in Spain. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong foundation in theoretical physics, particularly in quantum field theory. These days, my research focuses on supersymmetry, with growing interests in supergravity and string theory. I'm also exploring more unconventional scenarios, including nonlinear electrodynamics and Lorentz symmetry violation.
