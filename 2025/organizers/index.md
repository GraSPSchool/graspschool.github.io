  Hello, there! I'm Níck, a theoretical physicist. I got my MSc degree at the [Federal University of ABC](fisica.ufabc.edu.br/en/), a bit after getting my BSc at the [University of São Paulo's Institute of Physics](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/en). I work on the intersections between high-energy physics, mathematical physics, and gravitation.
