  Hello, there! I'm Níck, a theoretical physicist. I got my MSc degree at the [Federal University of ABC](fisica.ufabc.edu.br/en/), a bit after getting my BSc at the [University of São Paulo's Institute of Physics](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/en). I work on the intersections between high-energy physics, mathematical physics, and gravitation.

Hey Folks! I'm Caio, I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at the [Federal University of Ceará](https://www.fisica.ufc.br/portal/en/front-page/). I work as an undergrad research assistant in the Quantum Field Theory and Gravitation Group, and I have been working mainly in aspects of the Unruh effect, Hawking radiation and black hole shadows. You can find out more about me [here](https://usingcaio.github.io/).
