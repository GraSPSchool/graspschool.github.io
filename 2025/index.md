Join us once more for a week of general relativity and gravitation studies. The II São Paulo School on Gravitational Physics is an effort led by early-career researchers to explore and advertise the multiple facets of gravity. In 2025, we invite students with previous experience in general relativity to learn more about twistors and tests of strong gravity, while younger physicists will have the opportunity to learn about special relativity and the main principles of black hole physics.

Certificates will be issued to participants of a given minicourse upon attendance at 75% of the lectures.

The GraSP logo includes an apple drawn with Tikz using code from Mark Wibrow [available at TeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/413506/144146) and the shape of the state of São Paulo, which is based on the iconic sidewalks found in São Paulo designed by [Mirthes dos Santos Pinto](https://www.archdaily.com.br/br/902542/a-historia-do-famoso-desenho-de-calcada-de-sao-paulo).
