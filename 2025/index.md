Join us once more for a week of general relativity and gravitation studies! 

The II São Paulo School on Gravitational Physics is an initiative led by early-career researchers to explore and promote the multifaceted aspects of gravity. In 2025, we invite students with prior experience in general relativity to learn more about twistors and tests of strong gravity, while younger students will have the opportunity to explore special relativity and the fundamental principles of black hole physics.

II GraSP is part of the [ICTP Physics Without Frontiers](https://www.ictp.it/home/physics-without-frontiers) 2025 activities.

The GraSP logo includes an apple drawn with Tikz using code from Mark Wibrow [available at TeX Stack Exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/413506/144146) and the shape of the state of São Paulo, which is based on the iconic sidewalks found in São Paulo designed by [Mirthes dos Santos Pinto](https://www.archdaily.com.br/br/902542/a-historia-do-famoso-desenho-de-calcada-de-sao-paulo).
