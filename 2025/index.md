Embark on a captivating journey into contemporary lines of research in gravitational physics with our week-long online school tailored for students who studied general relativity at the undergraduate level. Led by a dynamic team of early-career researchers, this immersive experience offers an in-depth exploration of the frontiers in gravity research that are not covered in standard courses. Each course is meticulously crafted to illuminate cutting-edge topics, from the mysteries of inflationary cosmology to the nuances of relativistic astrophysics. Discover the philosophical underpinnings of relativity and the potential of gravitational waves and unravel the mysteries of GR’s IR behavior. Join us for a week of intellectual stimulation, vibrant discussions, and insights into the fascinating world of gravitational physics.

Certificates will be issued to participants of a given minicourse upon attendance at 75% of the lectures.
