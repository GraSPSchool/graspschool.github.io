# Registration Guide

Currently, the registration system at the University of São Paulo (USP) is written in Portuguese. For this reason, we provide the guide below on how to register to GraSP through the USP system. The system involves the creation of a "USP number", which is a code attributed to anyone that has ever had any affiliation with the University of São Paulo. If you ever attend another event or course at USP, your USP number will still be the same. Due to this, and due to the way Brazilian bureaucracy works, the system requires a number of personal data that is not directly relevant to the school (and which will not be made available to the school organizers), but which is deemed necessary by the university to avoid problems with homonyms. We thank you for your understanding and make ourselves available for any inquiries about this process through the e-mail address [graspschool@gmail.com](mailto:graspschool@gmail.com).

Please follow the instructions below to perform your registration to the school. 

**Step 1:** accessing the website 

The registration website is available [at this link](https://uspdigital.usp.br/apolo/inscricaoPublicaFormTurmaListar?codund=43&codcurceu=430400057&codedicurceu=24001&numseqofeedi=1&oriins=W). When you click on it, you will be shown the following page.

The only field to be entered is the Brazilian CPF, which is a form of Brazilian ID. This step can be skipped by clicking in the button reading "Avançar", which means to proceed. 

**Step 2:** e-mail and date of birth

The next page to be shown is the following.

The first field asks you for your e-mail (this is the e-mail which will be used for official school communication). The second field asks for your date of birth in the dd/mm/yyyy format. Finally, the third and last field is intended for you to complete the captcha check by typing in the characters shown in the picture. Once the three fields are filled, please click the "Avançar" button to proceed to the next page.

**Step 3:** USP number

The third page is the following.

This page asks for your USP number, in case you have one. 

If you do have a USP number, please inform it to avoid creating a new USP number for you in the USP system and then click the "Avançar" button to proceed to the next page. The next page will then be the last one and requires you only to check your data and confirm the registration.

If you do not have a USP number, leave the field blank. Click the blue hyperlink reading "clique aqui" which is above the entry field, to the left of the page, inside square brackets. Then proceed to step 4.

**Step 4:** personal data 

In case you don't have a USP number, this should be the last page. The first part of the page is the following.

The first block of entries is "Dados Pessoais" (personal data). The first entry asks for your name as registered in your ID. The following entry, which is a dropdown box, asks for your gender as specified in your ID, the options being "Masculino" (male) and "Feminino" (female).
