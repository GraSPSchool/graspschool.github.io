# Registration Guide

Currently, the registration system at the University of São Paulo (USP) is written in Portuguese. For this reason, we provide the guide below on how to register to GraSP through the USP system. The system involves the creation of a "USP number", which is a code attributed to anyone that has ever had any affiliation to the University of São Paulo. If you ever attend another event or course at USP, your USP number will still be the same. Due to this, and due to the way Brazilian bureaucracy works, the system requires a number of personal data that is not directly relevant to the school (and which will not be made available to the school organizers), but which is deemed necessary by the university to avoid problems with homonyms. We thank you for your understanding and make ourselves available for any inquiries about this process through the e-mail address [graspschool@gmail.com](mailto:graspschool@gmail.com).

Please follow the instructions below to perform your registration to the school.
