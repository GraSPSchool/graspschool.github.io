# Acknowledgments 

The organizers are grateful to Rafael Grossi e Fonseca (IFUSP), Prof. Daniel Cornejo (IFUSP), and the Culture and Extension Comission at the Institute of Physics at the University of São Paulo (CCEx–IFUSP) for helping us with the school organization.

The GraSP logo includes the shape of the state of São Paulo (based on the iconic anti-smoking plaques) and an apple draw with Tikz using code from Mark Wibrow available at TeX Stack Exchange.
