Join us once more for a week of general relativity and gravitation studies! 

The II São Paulo School on Gravitational Physics is an initiative led by early-career researchers to explore and promote the multifaceted aspects of gravity. In 2025, we invite students with prior experience in general relativity to learn more about twistors and tests of strong gravity, while younger students will have the opportunity to explore special relativity and the fundamental principles of black hole physics.
