Embark on a captivating journey into contemporary lines of research in gravitational physics with our week-long online school tailored for students who studied general relativity at the undergraduate level. Led by a dynamic team of early-career researchers, this immersive experience offers an in-depth exploration of the frontiers in gravity research that are not covered in standard courses. From the mysteries of inflationary cosmology to the nuances of relativistic astrophysics, each course is meticulously crafted to illuminate cutting-edge topics. Discover the philosophical underpinnings of relativity and the potential of gravitational waves and unravel the mysteries of GR’s IR behavior. Join us for a week of intellectual stimulation, vibrant discussions, and insights into the fascinating world of gravitational physics.

Certificates will be issued to participants of a given minicourse upon comparison to 75% of the lectures of that minicourse. A passport number or a Brazilian document (RNE or CPF) is necessary for the emission of the certificate.
