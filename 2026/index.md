Join us once more for a week of general relativity and gravitation studies! 

The III São Paulo School on Gravitational Physics is an initiative led by early-career researchers to explore and promote the various aspects of gravity. In 2026, we invite you to explore topics ranging from celestial holography to algebraic quantum field theory, passing through stellar astrophysics and the Unruh effect.
