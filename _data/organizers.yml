    Hello, there! I am Níckolas de Aguiar Alves, or Níck for short. My pronouns are he/him. I am a PhD candidate at the Federal University of ABC, Brazil. I work on many aspects of gravitation, with a particular taste for its interface with quantum mechanics. Most of my current work centers on understanding the infrared behavior of gravity. More generally, my research interests span quantum field theory, general relativity, and quantum aspects of gravitation.

    Hey Folks! I'm Caio, I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at the Federal University of Ceará. I work as an undergrad research assistant in the Quantum Field Theory and Gravitation Group, and I have been working mainly in aspects of the Unruh effect, Hawking radiation and black hole shadows. You can find out more about me [here](https://usingcaio.github.io/).

    Hi! I'm Clara, a theoretical physicist currently pursuing a PhD in the Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Gravitation program (PPGCosmo) at the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), Brazil. I completed my MSc in Physics at the University of Valencia and earned my undergraduate degree in Physics Education from the University of Seville, both in Spain. Over the years, I've developed a strong foundation in theoretical physics, particularly in quantum field theory. These days, my research focuses on supersymmetry, with growing interests in supergravity and string theory. I'm also exploring more unconventional scenarios, including nonlinear electrodynamics and Lorentz symmetry violation.
