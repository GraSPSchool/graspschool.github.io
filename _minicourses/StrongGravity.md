**Lecturer:** Prajwal Hassan Puttasiddappa, MSc (U. Oslo and Espírito Santo U.)

**Schedule:** 

**Workload:** 10h

**Topics:** What is strong-gravity regime? What are the observables in this regime? What are the tools to analyze the data? Are these tools independent of assumptions? What can we tell about the nature of gravity very close to black holes?

**Overview:** We explore modern techniques available for tests of gravity using stellar orbits and photon dynamics near the Galactic Center. We will analyze stellar motion and infer orbital parameters using both traditional Bayesian statistics and neural networks. We will also look at the possibility of using black hole shadow measurements to constrain deviations from Schwarzschild geometry. We will through exercises.

**Pre-requisites:** Introductory astronomy, basic Python and Mathematica.
